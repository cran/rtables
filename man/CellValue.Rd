\usage{

}
\arguments{
\item{val}{ANY. value in the cell exactly as it should be passed to a formatter or returned when extracted}

\item{format}{FormatSpec. Format associated with this split. Formats can be declared via strings (\code{"xx.x"}) or function. In cases such as \code{analyze} calls, they can character vectors or lists of functions.}

\item{colspan}{integer. Generally ignored currently.}

\item{label}{used as row name if the row name is not specified by \code{in_rows}}

\item{indent_mod}{numeric. Modifier for the default indent position for the structure created by this function(subtable, content table, or row) \emph{and all of that structure's children}. Defaults to 0, which corresponds to the unmodified default behavior.}
}
\value{
